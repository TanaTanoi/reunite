This Combined Earthquake hazard shapefile is a compilation of all "combined earthquake hazard" ArcInfo coverages in major urban areas of the Wellington Region. The coverages represent overlays of all previous earthquake hazard data.  
  
  *  1. Area of tsunami inundation  
  *  2. 20m buffer along major fault traces  
  *  3. Ground shaking  
  *  4. Liquefaction potential

##Wellington Region Earthquake Induced Slope Failure  
  
[http://data-gwrc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/760f757598f44a2ca32573faf5fa87e7_11](http://data-gwrc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/760f757598f44a2ca32573faf5fa87e7_11)  
We're using this to data indicate risk of slips from rain events for route closures.
  
**Original source**: Greater Wellington Regional Council  
  
**Description**
  
Slope failure includes all types of failures in slopes, including falls, slides, avalanches, flows, and slumps in both soil and rock. Failures caused by liquefaction are excluded from this study. Earthquake induced slope failures are defined as those caused directly or triggered by earthquakes. The majority of earthquake induced slope failures will occur during earthquake shaking. However, some slopes weakened by earthquake shaking may fail days or weeks after the earthquake. Aftershocks or high intensity and/or long duration rainfall may trigger such failures.

*Used to identify School property polygons rather than points.  The challenge was some school properties are a collection of properties rather than a single package.*  
  
**Original source:** LINZ and Ollivier & Co.  
  
**Description**  
  
Survey parcel polygons for whole of NZ + Chatham Islands. (*Dataset clipped to WGTN Region*)  
  
Parcel polygons are a space filling layer covering the whole of New Zealand out to the 12 nautical mile limit. All areas are covered and numbered with a static unique parcel ID (PAR_ID). Thus roads, lakes, rivers and the sea are all parcels.
